# Singing-Voice-Detection-GeorgiaTech-MUSI7100-spring17

Detects regions in audio where singing voice is present.
Singing voice may be monophonic or even contain overlapping 
instrumentation/orchestration or noise. 
SVM and DNNs are explored in this project.
The input feature representation is also explored, where the
conventional spectral features extracted from the magnitude
response are replaced with features extracted from the phase response.
